# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1*

![title for sketch1](fp-images/sketch1.png)
![sketch 1 for idea 1](../assets/fp-images/IMG_0683.jpg)
![sketch 2 for idea 1](../assets/fp-images/IMG_0684.jpg)
 Idea 1: Hidden Objects game 
This is a “wheres Waldo” type game where i will have a very complex scene (that I will draw) and have a menu bar of items that players need to find on the scene. Once a user finds an object, they will click on it, and the item will disappear and a confirmation will show up. Once the user finds all the objects in the scene, the game will proceed to the next level. 
Since this is a very visual game, I plan on making the menu items and instructions as simple as possible to reduce users’ cognitive load. The scene where users will need to find objects will be intentionally very very confusing and complex, and to offload this balance I will make the surrounding interactions very plain and simple, with only two CTAs: hints, and exit. There will be a menu on the bottom of the screen that shows the users progress (found items and not found items). 

### *Idea 2*
![sketch 1 for idea 2](../assets/fp-images/IMG_0685.jpg)
![sketch 2 for idea 2](../assets/fp-images/IMG_0686.jpg)
Idea 2: Cooking Game 
Main idea: I will have a bunch of ingredients (all of which I will be drawing myself) and users can select as many ingredients as they want, and once they press [Make], the site will take the selected ingredients and make it into a recipe while also detailing the steps and how to make them. 
I will include a screen reader that reads the ingredients on the screen along with the CTAs so that it can be accessible and easy to navigate. 
…

### *Idea 3*
![sketch for idea 3](../assets/fp-images/IMG_0687.jpg)
Idea 3: Personal Profile
I want to make a personal profile that details my professional and creative work, with an interactive about me section 
I plan on making it interactive by putting in places where users can mouse over to reveal more Information. But i plan on keeping the interactions simple so as to not distract from the rest of my portfolio 
I plan on making my design accessible by not adding in too much text, it will be heavy on images and illustrations, and I will have alt text under all my images. I will also research into my color palette to make sure the colors are within ADA guidelines.
…

## Feedback Summary

Critiques during lab:
During the lab session, I received valuable critiques that helped shape my approach to my personal website and portfolio. One key suggestion was to think more deeply about how I want to express myself and my interests through the design and content of my site. For instance, in the "About Me" section, I was encouraged to provide more personal insight into my passions and experiences, and include more physical mediums instead of purely digital things.  For the interactive recipe guide I’m developing, the feedback focused on making it more engaging and fun. Since I am already gamifying cooking, suggestions included gamifying the cooking experience, drawing inspiration from games like Breath of the Wild and Cooking mama to create fixed but playful interactions, especially around ingredient selection. This would make the process more interactive and enjoyable for users.
For the hidden object game I’m creating, similar to Where’s Waldo, the critiques urged me to incorporate a narrative component. The feedback suggested that finding objects could serve a deeper purpose, telling a story and connecting to a larger concept. I was also advised to explore creative ways to generate the levels, such as incorporating a show/hide search menu and developing assets that could be randomly generated to make each scene feel unique and dynamic. I was also suggested to draw a myriad of “small scenes” that depict detailed scenes but sort of like a puzzle piece, they can be standalone scenes but can also be pieced together. Then I can write an algorithm that pieces these separate scenes together randomly to generate new random scenes for users to search through every time, instead of a fixed scene for every level. These critiques helped me to not only focus on the mechanics of the game but also think about how these elements could contribute to a richer, more meaningful user experience. 

## Feedback Digestion
Moving forward: 
The feedback I received during the lab session gave me valuable insights into the strengths and areas for improvement in my personal website and project designs. One thing I emphasized in my group critiques was that I wanted to incorporate illustration in some way in my final project, whether it be interactive or static. One of the most significant critiques focused on how I present myself through my personal site and portfolio. I was encouraged to think more deeply about how I want to express my personality and interests through illustrated elements. This feedback struck a chord with me, as I realized that the “About Me” section should go beyond a basic bio and become a space to reflect my passions and interests more vividly. I plan to act on this critique by reworking the content of this section to give visitors a better sense of who I am with more interactives and maybe a visual map that users can both click in or just sit back and watch the map unfold. 
Regarding the hidden object game, the critique about adding the random scene generator is something I am interested in implementing. I had originally intended to draw out 5-6 scenes, heavily packed with people/items like Where’s Waldo, but my classmate suggested that I instead draw out smaller sections, and use code to piece these different sections together randomly to create different random scenes for players to experience. I could then stitch them together like a triptych, and it would be more fun since the scene will be unpredictable every time. I could keep a fixed set of assets, which could be the things that users would need to find in every scene.  Storytelling could provide context and purpose to the object-finding mechanic, making the game more compelling. On the other hand, I may not fully explore random level generation at this stage, as I want to focus on refining the core user experience first before delving into technical complexity.
Ultimately, I chose to incorporate feedback that aligns with my goals of creating fun, meaningful, and accessible designs while ensuring the user experience remains my top priority.
